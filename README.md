# PCA_Implementation
Implemented PCA technique from scratch

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique which is quite helpful for fetaure engineering steps. Our project targets to create a package from scratch which carries out functionalities of PCA method from scratch. We have created 2 classes and logic of our implementation is written as different functions.

The utlity of this package includes:
1. PCA implementation from scratch
2. A function returning number of components one would need to retain specific percentage of variance in top PCA components
3. 2D plot for representing 2 components
4. 3D plot for representing 3 components
5. For more than 3 components, visualziation of cummulative variance versus number of components
